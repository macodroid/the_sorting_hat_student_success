# TODO

## Data analysis

- [X] look for missing values
- [ ] plot courses vs target
- [ ] what is mean age of graduate's and mean age of dropout's
- [ ] what is mother and father occupation for those graduated and those who dropout
- [ ] what is mother and father qualification for those graduated and those who dropout
- [ ] what nationality has most graduate's and dropout's
- [ ] Is someone has scholarship does this mean that they will be successful ?

## plan

- [X] one hot encoding (little bit confusing ?? because dataset has multiple categorical values)
- [ ] split data
- [ ] scale data (first StandardScaler fit and transform train and then test)
